				<h3>Tim Hortons Hockey Challenge</h3>

					This app helps you make Tim Hortons Hockey Challenge picks in the Tims app.
					It ranks candidates for Pick #1, Pick #2, and Pick #3 using implied probabilities
					from sportsbook odds, with normalization to improve book-to-book comparability.

				<h3>Features</h3>
				<p>
					Selecting picks from different games can improve total hit probability by reducing
					correlation between picks. When picks come from independent games, outcomes are
					less tied together than when multiple picks come from the same game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once games start, available pick quality can shift. Listing all players helps judge
					whether to lock picks early or wait for later opportunities.

					<h3>How Odds Are Balanced</h3>
					<p>
						The percentages shown are implied probabilities derived from sportsbook odds.
						The app then normalizes books to reduce systematic pricing differences so books are more comparable.
					</p>
					<p>
						In practice, this means each sportsbook is scaled toward the consensus of the other books
						(de-vig normalization), helping separate real player signal from sportsbook-specific bias.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sportsbooks include a margin known as <strong>vig</strong> (also called <strong>juice</strong>),
						so normalization helps align books onto a more comparable baseline.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the <strong>Settings</strong>,
						use the <strong>Show Probabilities</strong> toggle to switch between percentage and American odds display,
						and the <strong>Normalize Sportsbooks</strong> to toggle normalized percentages.

				<h3>Stats</h3>
				<p>
					The <strong>Stats</strong> button displays the top picks from the average sportsbook's odds,
					with sportsbook buttons to dispaly the top picks specific to each sportsbook.
				</p>
				<p>
					Selecting an already selected sportsbook deselects it,
					restores the display to the average results.
				</p>
				<p>
					Baseline log-ratio correlation is used to estimate how much picks from the same game,
					whether on opposing teams or the same team,
					are correlated relative to a baseline of independent picks from different games.
				</p>
				<p>
					With 2 or less games where all three picks cannot be independent from different games,
					correlation is based on random results.
