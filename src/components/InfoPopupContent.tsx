				<p><strong>What this app does</strong></p>
				<p>This app shows NHL anytime goal scorer probabilities from four sportsbooks — DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and BetRivers — for today's games.</p>
				<p>The percentages are <strong>implied probabilities</strong> derived from each sportsbook's offered odds. For example, odds of −150 imply a 60% chance. Sportsbooks build a profit margin (vig or juice) into their lines, so the displayed probabilities are slightly inflated relative to the true odds. The <strong>#</strong> button switches the display to show the original American odds instead.</p>
				<p>Three picks are nominated per slot (Pick #1, #2, #3). The goal is to select one player per slot with the highest chance of scoring, where no two picks play in the same game.</p>
				<p>The <strong>Avg</strong> column is the mean implied probability across all sportsbooks that list the player. The <strong>G/GP</strong> column shows each player's goals-per-game rate, converted to a Poisson goal probability for reference.</p>
				<p>Clicking a sportsbook logo shows that book's optimal picks. The <strong>📊</strong> button shows the optimal picks by average, accounting for game conflicts.</p>
