				<h3>Tim Hortons Hockey Challenge</h3>
				<p>
					This app helps make Tim Hortons Hockey Challenge picks in the Tims app.
					It ranks candidates for Pick #1, Pick #2, and Pick #3 using implied probabilities
					from sportsbook odds, with normalization to improve book-to-book comparability.
				</p>

				<h3>Features</h3>
				<p>
					Selecting picks from different games can improve total hit probability by reducing
					correlation between picks. When picks come from independent games, outcomes are
					less tied together than when multiple picks come from the same game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once games start, available pick quality can shift. Listing all players helps judge
					whether to lock picks early or wait for later opportunities.

				<h3>How Odds Are Balanced</h3>
				<p>
					The percentages shown are implied probabilities derived from sportsbook odds.
					The app then normalizes books to reduce systematic pricing differences so books are more comparable.
				</p>
				<p>
					In practice, this means each sportsbook is scaled toward the consensus of the other books
					(de-vig normalization), helping separate real player signal from sportsbook-specific bias.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sportsbooks include a margin known as <strong>vig</strong> (also called <strong>juice</strong>),
					so normalization helps align books onto a more comparable baseline.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use the <strong>#</strong> button to switch between percentage view and American odds view.

				<h3>Stats and Sportsbook Buttons</h3>
				<p>
					The <strong>📊</strong> stats button and sportsbook logo buttons display the top picks,
					and, if any picks are from the same game, if possible, the next best picks using players from different games.
				</p>
				<p>
					The sportsbook buttons (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, or BetRivers)
					display the picks using that sportsbook's odds.
					The <strong>📊</strong> stats button displays the picks based on the average odds across all
					sportsbooks.
				</p>
				<p>
					This lets you compare how picks change by source while keeping one consistent optimization method.
